  "description": "[commercelayer.io](https://commercelayer.io)\\\nAfter 14 years in consulting, working on various e-commerce products for a wide range of clients, I decided to join a product company, bringing my experience in building e-commerce solutions. Commerce Layer is an API-first commerce engine, and when I joined, there was a need to build tools and products around these APIs.\n\nI started by developing the [demo store](https://commercelayer.github.io/demo-store-core), a fully functional e-commerce website that customers can use as a reference point or a starting template.\\\nI introduced the concept of micro-frontends, which I had used in my previous experience. This led to the creation of [drop-in.js](https://commercelayer.github.io/drop-in.js), an open-source project that enables commerce capabilities (such as product availability, pricing, cart, and more) on any website, simply by copying and pasting HTML custom elements.\n\nSince our tools are primarily used by developers, we constantly face the challenge of enhancing the developer experience, which is an aspect I really enjoy. I introduced best practices to improve our internal DX, and Iâ€™m passionate about bringing the same quality externally as well.",
