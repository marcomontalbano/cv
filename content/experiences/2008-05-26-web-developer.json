  "description": "I began my career with Sisal, where I worked on SuperEnalotto, WinForLife, and Match-Point websites as an Oracle Portal developer. Then I moved on to fashion e-commerce with Balenciaga and Stella McCartney when I first approached Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly Demandware). Afterwards, I worked on a fully custom cms and e-commerce built with Ruby on Rails for Gucci. In the meantime I also worked on Gucci side-projects like Chime for Change and Gucci Museo, both with Ruby on Rails. Then I moved back to Salesforce Commerce Cloud projects with OVS and Coin Casa, this time as a Team Leader. From that moment on, I worked both as Team Leader and Architect on several projects, including major ones like Fendi, Unieuro, and Acea, this time using SAP Commerce Cloud (formerly Hybris).\n\nDuring these years, I learned many different things. I started as a Junior Developer on Java projects and rapidly moved on to frontend development skills. Moreover, I didn't want to be stuck on something specific, I wanted to learn a little bit of everything on my way to be full-stack. As my skills grew, so did my responsibilities.\\\nI think that knowledge works better when shared so I spent a lot of my time coaching my team members and colleagues."
