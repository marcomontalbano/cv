  "description": "Alongside my responsibilities as a tech leader, I was promoted to Senior Manager.\n\nI dedicated significant time and effort to enhancing internal expertise by fostering a learning culture that promoted continuous growth, knowledge sharing, and adaptability, helping the company remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market. I also devised and taught a course called [An Introduction to Frontend](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/an-introduction-to-frontend) to introduce frontend development to backend developers and interns at Sopra Steria.\n\nI collaborated closely with the HR department to improve our tech recruitment process and design a better journey for interns. Due to positive results, I was asked to share these insights with colleagues at our offices in Rome and Parma."
